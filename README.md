# Introduction

This app can detect if a user has fallen and if so, it informs an emergency contact set by user.

# A bit more detail

1. The user configures their emergency contact.
2. They set the way the app is going to inform the emergency contact, if a fall is identified (via a phone call or via SMS).
3. If SMS communication way is chosen, the user can select whether they want their location to be retrieved and shared.
4. The user sets the fall detection mode on and the app starts detecting if a fall happens.
