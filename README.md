# Introduction

This app can detect if a user has fallen and if so it informs the emergency contact set by user.

# A bit more detail

1. The user configures his/her emergency contact.
2. Sets the way the app is going to inform the emergency contact if a fall happens (via Call or via SMS).
3. If SMS communication way is chosen, the user can select weather he/she wants their location to be retrieved.
4. The user sets the fall detection mode on and the app starts detecting if a fall happens.
